# Admin Features Implementation Summary

## ✅ Features Implemented

### 1. **Admin User Account**
- **Default Credentials**: 
  - Username: `admin`
  - Password: `admin29`
- **Auto-created**: Admin user is automatically created when the database is initialized
- **Role-based Access**: Admin users have `role = 'admin'` in the database

### 2. **Admin Tools Interface**
- **Admin Panel**: Full-featured admin panel with tabbed interface
- **Model Management Tab**: Import, switch, and manage TensorFlow Lite models
- **Export Logs Tab**: Placeholder for future export functionality
- **Responsive Design**: Clean, modern UI that matches the app's design language

### 3. **Model Import/Update System**
- **File Picker Integration**: Uses `file_picker` to select `.tflite` files
- **Multiple Sources**: Can import from downloads folder or any accessible location
- **Automatic Validation**: Validates file extension and existence
- **Safe Storage**: Models are copied to app's documents directory
- **Database Tracking**: All imported models are tracked in SQLite database

### 4. **Model Management**
- **Current Model Persistence**: Uses `shared_preferences` to remember active model
- **Model Switching**: Easy switching between imported models
- **Default Model Fallback**: Always maintains access to original default model
- **Model List**: Visual list of all available models with status indicators
- **Safe Deletion**: Prevents deletion of currently active models

### 5. **Dynamic Model Loading**
- **Runtime Model Switching**: App uses the currently selected model for all classifications
- **Fallback System**: Automatically reverts to default model if selected model becomes unavailable
- **Asset & File Support**: Supports both bundled asset models and imported file models
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of missing or corrupted model files

### 6. **Admin UI Integration**
- **Conditional Display**: Admin tools only appear for users with admin role
- **Prominent Placement**: Admin tools section clearly visible on main page
- **Quick Access**: Direct access to model import and management
- **Visual Distinction**: Orange-themed admin section stands out from regular UI

## 🛠️ Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2    # For storing current model preferences
  file_picker: ^8.0.0+1         # For importing model files
  path_provider: ^2.1.1         # For accessing app directories
```

## 🔧 Database Schema Updates

### Users Table (Updated)
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  firstName TEXT NOT NULL,
  lastName TEXT NOT NULL,
  username TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  password TEXT NOT NULL,
  createdAt INTEGER NOT NULL,
  role TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'user'  -- NEW: Role column
);
```

### Imported Models Table (New)
```sql
CREATE TABLE imported_models (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  path TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  importedAt INTEGER NOT NULL,
  isDefault INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  description TEXT
);
```

## 🎯 Admin Workflow

### Model Import Process
1. Admin user logs in with credentials (`admin` / `admin29`)
2. Admin tools section appears on home page
3. Click "Import/Update Model" button
4. Opens admin panel with model management tab
5. Click "Import Model" to open file picker
6. Select `.tflite` file from any location
7. Model is copied to app storage and registered
8. Admin can switch to new model immediately

### Model Management Process
1. View all available models in the admin panel
2. See current active model highlighted
3. Switch between models with confirmation dialogs
4. Delete unused imported models (with safety checks)
5. Revert to default model at any time

### Model Selection Persistence
1. Selected model is saved in shared preferences
2. App remembers choice across restarts
3. Classification service uses selected model
4. Fallback to default if selected model unavailable

## 🔐 Security Features

### Role-Based Access Control
- Admin tools only visible to users with `role = 'admin'`
- Regular users cannot access admin functionality
- Admin status persists across sessions

### File Management Security
- Models stored in app-specific directories
- Validation of file types before import
- Safe deletion with confirmation dialogs
- Protection against deleting active models

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### For Regular Users
- No changes to existing workflow
- All classification features work as before
- No access to admin tools

### For Admin Users
1. Login with username: `admin`, password: `admin29`
2. Look for orange "Admin Tools" section on home page
3. Use "Import/Update Model" for full model management
4. Use "Export Logs" button (placeholder for future feature)

### Model Import
1. Prepare `.tflite` model file (e.g., download to device)
2. Access admin tools from home page
3. Navigate to Model Management tab
4. Click "Import Model" button
5. Select model file using file picker
6. Provide descriptive name for the model
7. Model imported and available for selection

### Model Switching
1. View available models in admin panel
2. Click "Select" on desired model
3. Confirm switch in dialog
4. New model becomes active immediately
5. All future classifications use new model

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Model Versioning**: Track model versions and rollback capabilities
- **Export Functionality**: Complete implementation of log export
- **Batch Operations**: Import/manage multiple models at once
- **Cloud Integration**: Import models from cloud storage
- **Model Backup**: Backup and restore model collections

## 📋 Export Logs Feature (Placeholder)

The export logs functionality is implemented as a placeholder that:
- Shows appropriate UI in the admin panel
- Displays "coming soon" messaging
- Has proper error handling for unimplemented features
- Is ready for future implementation with database integration
