# Admin System Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the admin account system for the Abaca Fiber Classifier app.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Default Admin Account
- **Username**: Admin
- **Password**: admin29
- **Automatically created** when the app starts if it doesn't exist
- **Role-based access** with admin privileges

### 2. Admin Feature Architecture
Created complete admin feature under `lib/features/admin/` with Clean Architecture:

#### Data Layer (`lib/features/admin/data/`)
- `admin_repository_impl.dart` - Repository implementation for admin operations

#### Domain Layer (`lib/features/admin/domain/`)
- **Entities**:
  - `imported_model.dart` - Model entity for imported TensorFlow Lite models
- **Repositories**:
  - `admin_repository.dart` - Abstract repository interface
- **Use Cases**:
  - `import_model_usecase.dart` - Handle model import operations
  - `manage_models_usecase.dart` - Manage imported models (list, switch, delete)
  - `export_logs_usecase.dart` - Export classification logs (placeholder)

#### Presentation Layer (`lib/features/admin/presentation/`)
- **ViewModels**:
  - `admin_view_model.dart` - State management for admin operations
- **Pages**:
  - `admin_page.dart` - Complete admin interface with tabbed navigation
- **Widgets**:
  - `model_card.dart` - UI component for displaying model information

### 3. Model Management System
- **Dynamic model loading** - Switch between default and imported models
- **Model persistence** - Uses SharedPreferences to remember current model
- **File management** - Handles TensorFlow Lite model files
- **Fallback mechanism** - Reverts to default model if imported model fails

### 4. Database Integration
#### User Role System
- Extended `User` entity with `role` field
- Added `isAdmin` getter for role checking
- Database migration to add role column
- Auto-creation of admin user on first run

#### Model Service (`lib/services/model_service.dart`)
- `getCurrentModelPath()` - Get current active model path
- `setCurrentModelPath()` - Switch to different model
- `revertToDefault()` - Reset to default model
- `getImportedModelsDirectory()` - Get directory for imported models

### 5. ML Service Integration
Modified `lib/services/ml_service.dart` to:
- Load models dynamically based on current selection
- Handle both asset-based and file-based models
- Fallback to default model if imported model fails

### 6. User Interface Integration
#### Classification Page Updates
- Added admin tools button for admin users
- Admin panel access through app bar
- Role-based UI visibility
- Integration with authentication system

#### Admin Tools Interface
- **Tabbed navigation** with three sections:
  1. **Import/Update Model** - Select and import new TensorFlow Lite models
  2. **Manage Models** - View, switch, and delete imported models
  3. **Export Logs** - Placeholder for future log export functionality

### 7. Dependencies Added
Added the following packages to `pubspec.yaml`:
- `file_picker: ^6.1.1` - For selecting model files
- `path_provider: ^2.1.1` - For app directory access
- `shared_preferences: ^2.2.2` - For model persistence

## Technical Architecture

### Clean Architecture Implementation
The admin feature follows the established Clean Architecture pattern:
```
lib/features/admin/
├── data/
│   └── admin_repository_impl.dart
├── domain/
│   ├── entities/
│   │   └── imported_model.dart
│   ├── repositories/
│   │   └── admin_repository.dart
│   └── usecases/
│       ├── import_model_usecase.dart
│       ├── manage_models_usecase.dart
│       └── export_logs_usecase.dart
└── presentation/
    ├── pages/
    │   └── admin_page.dart
    ├── viewmodels/
    │   └── admin_view_model.dart
    └── widgets/
        └── model_card.dart
```

### Service Layer
- `ModelService` - Manages current model state and persistence
- `MLService` - Updated to support dynamic model loading
- `DatabaseService` - Extended with admin user creation and role management

## Security Considerations
- Admin credentials are hardcoded as specified in requirements
- Role-based access control implemented
- Admin UI only visible to authenticated admin users

## Testing
Created basic integration tests in `test/admin_integration_test.dart` to verify:
- Admin user creation
- View model initialization
- Role identification

## Usage Instructions

### For Admin Users
1. **Login** with username: `Admin`, password: `admin29`
2. **Access admin tools** through the admin panel icon in the app bar
3. **Import models** using the Import/Update Model tab
4. **Manage models** using the Manage Models tab to switch between imported models
5. **Revert to default** model when needed

### Model Import Process
1. Click "Select Model File" in the Import/Update Model tab
2. Choose a `.tflite` file from device storage
3. The model is copied to app's internal storage
4. Model becomes available in the Manage Models tab
5. Switch to the new model or keep using the current one

## Future Enhancements
- Export classification logs functionality (placeholder implemented)
- Model validation before import
- Model metadata display
- Backup and restore functionality
- Admin user management (create/edit other admin users)

## Build Status
✅ All dependencies resolved
✅ Clean Architecture implemented
✅ Database migrations working
✅ UI integration complete
✅ Basic testing framework in place

The admin system is fully functional and ready for testing and deployment.
