# Enhanced Error Handling for TensorFlow Lite Model Switching

## Overview
The system now provides comprehensive error handling for TensorFlow Lite model compatibility issues, ensuring that the UI remains consistent and users receive clear feedback when models fail to load.

## Error Scenarios Handled

### 1. TensorFlow Lite Operator Compatibility Issues
**Error Pattern**: `Didn't find op for builtin opcode 'FULLY_CONNECTED' version '12'`

**Root Cause**: The imported model uses TensorFlow Lite operators or versions not supported by the current runtime.

**System Response**:
- Catches the `Unable to create interpreter` error
- Provides specific error message: "Model compatibility error: This model uses operators not supported by the current TensorFlow Lite runtime"
- Automatically reverts to the previous working model
- Updates UI to show the correct active model (not the failed import)

### 2. Corrupted Model Files
**Error Pattern**: `Invalid argument(s): Unable to create interpreter`

**System Response**:
- Detects interpreter creation failure
- Shows error: "Failed to create TensorFlow Lite interpreter: The model file may be corrupted or incompatible"
- Reverts to previous model
- Maintains UI consistency

### 3. Missing Model Files
**Error Pattern**: File system error when model file doesn't exist

**System Response**:
- Validates file existence before attempting to load
- Shows error: "Model file not found: [path]. Reverted to default model."
- Automatically falls back to default model

## Implementation Details

### ML Service Error Handling
```dart
// lib/services/ml_service.dart
try {
  // Load model logic
} catch (e) {
  // Provide specific error messages for common issues
  String errorMessage;
  if (e.toString().contains('FULLY_CONNECTED') || 
      e.toString().contains('builtin opcode')) {
    errorMessage = 'Model compatibility error: This model uses operators not supported by the current TensorFlow Lite runtime. Please use a model compatible with TensorFlow Lite v2.x';
  } else if (e.toString().contains('Unable to create interpreter')) {
    errorMessage = 'Failed to create TensorFlow Lite interpreter: The model file may be corrupted or incompatible';
  } else {
    errorMessage = 'Model loading failed: ${e.toString()}';
  }
  
  dispose(); // Clean up resources
  throw Exception(errorMessage);
}
```

### Admin View Model Error Recovery
```dart
// lib/features/admin/presentation/viewmodels/admin_view_model.dart
try {
  await _classificationViewModel.reloadModel();
  // Only update UI state if reload was successful
  _currentModel = model;
  _successMessage = 'Successfully switched to model: ${model.name}';
} catch (reloadError) {
  // Revert both model service and UI state
  await _manageModelsUseCase.setActiveModel(previousModelPath);
  await _classificationViewModel.reloadModel();
  _currentModel = previousModel; // Keep UI showing correct model
  _error = 'Detailed error message based on error type';
}
```

### UI State Consistency
- **Model Cards**: Only show "ACTIVE" status for models that successfully loaded
- **Current Model Display**: Always reflects the actually loaded model, not the attempted switch
- **Error Messages**: Extended duration (6 seconds) with dismiss action for better user experience

## Error Messages by Type

### Operator Compatibility Error
```
Model "my_model.tflite" is incompatible with the current TensorFlow Lite runtime. 
This model uses unsupported operators. Please use a TensorFlow Lite v2.x compatible model. 
Reverted to previous model.
```

### Corrupted Model Error
```
Model "my_model.tflite" could not be loaded - the file may be corrupted or incompatible. 
Reverted to previous model.
```

### File Not Found Error
```
Model file not found: /path/to/model.tflite. Reverted to default model.
```

### Critical System Error
```
Critical error: Both target model and default model failed to load. 
[Original error details]
```

## Console Debug Output

### Successful Model Switch
```
I/flutter: Loading model from path: /data/user/0/.../models/model.tflite
I/flutter: Loading file model: /data/user/0/.../models/model.tflite
I/flutter: Model loaded successfully with input: shape=[1,224,224,3] type=float32, output: shape=[1,8] type=float32
I/flutter: Model reloaded in classification system
```

### Failed Model Switch with Recovery
```
I/flutter: Loading model from path: /data/user/0/.../models/incompatible_model.tflite
I/flutter: Loading file model: /data/user/0/.../models/incompatible_model.tflite
E/tflite: Didn't find op for builtin opcode 'FULLY_CONNECTED' version '12'
E/tflite: Registration failed.
I/flutter: Error loading model: Exception: Model compatibility error: This model uses operators not supported by the current TensorFlow Lite runtime
I/flutter: Error during model reload, attempting fallback to default: Exception: Model compatibility error...
I/flutter: Model reload failed: Exception: Failed to load model: Model compatibility error... Automatically reverted to default model.
I/flutter: Loading model from path: assets/mobilenetv3small_b2.tflite
I/flutter: Loading asset model: assets/mobilenetv3small_b2.tflite
I/flutter: Model loaded successfully with input: shape=[1,224,224,3] type=float32, output: shape=[1,8] type=float32
```

## Benefits

### 1. Robust Error Recovery
- No crashes or undefined states
- Automatic fallback to working models
- Graceful handling of all error scenarios

### 2. Clear User Feedback
- Specific error messages explaining the issue
- Actionable guidance (e.g., "use TensorFlow Lite v2.x compatible model")
- Visual feedback through extended snackbar duration

### 3. UI Consistency
- Model cards always reflect actual system state
- No misleading "ACTIVE" indicators on failed models
- Proper loading states during model switches

### 4. Developer Debugging
- Comprehensive console logging
- Clear error propagation
- Detailed error categorization

## Testing Scenarios

### Test 1: Compatible Model
1. Import a valid TensorFlow Lite v2.x model
2. Switch to the model
3. Verify success message and "ACTIVE" status
4. Confirm classification uses new model

### Test 2: Incompatible Model (Operator Version)
1. Import a model with unsupported operators
2. Attempt to switch to the model
3. Verify error message mentions operator compatibility
4. Confirm UI shows previous model as active
5. Test classification to ensure previous model is still working

### Test 3: Corrupted Model File
1. Import a corrupted .tflite file
2. Attempt to switch to the model
3. Verify error message mentions corruption
4. Confirm automatic revert to previous model

### Test 4: Missing Model File
1. Import a model successfully
2. Manually delete the model file from storage
3. Attempt to switch to the deleted model
4. Verify error message and automatic fallback

This comprehensive error handling ensures that TensorFlow Lite model switching is robust, user-friendly, and maintains system stability even when encountering incompatible or corrupted models.
