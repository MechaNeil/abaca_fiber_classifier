# Admin User Restrictions Implementation Summary

## Overview

I have successfully implemented user role-based restrictions to hide sensitive classification information from non-admin users. The changes ensure that regular users cannot see detailed grade distributions and low confidence classification details, while admin users retain full access to all information.

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. **Classification Results Page Restrictions**

#### **For Non-Admin Users:**
- **Hidden Grade Distribution**: The grade distribution charts are completely hidden for both successful (>50% confidence) and failed (≤50% confidence) classifications
- **Low Confidence Label**: Results with ≤50% confidence display "Cannot be classified" instead of "We couldn't classify the fiber"
- **No Probability Details**: Grade probability breakdowns are not shown

#### **For Admin Users:**
- **Full Access**: All grade distributions, probability details, and model information remain visible
- **Diagnostic Information**: Model name and detailed confidence information are displayed
- **Original Behavior**: Maintains the existing detailed view for administrative analysis

### 2. **History Page Restrictions**

#### **Classification Summary (Statistics Overview):**
- **Hidden for Non-Admin**: The "Classification Summary" section with grade statistics is completely hidden from regular users
- **Admin Only**: Grade distribution charts and counts are only visible to admin users

#### **History List Items:**
- **Low Confidence Items**: For non-admin users, history items with ≤50% confidence show:
  - Grade badge displays "Cannot be classified" with grey color
  - Confidence percentage is hidden
- **High Confidence Items**: Normal display with grade and confidence for all users

#### **Details Dialog:**
- **Modified Grade Display**: Low confidence results show "Cannot be classified" instead of the actual grade for non-admin users
- **Hidden Confidence**: Confidence percentage is hidden for low confidence results for non-admin users
- **Admin Information**: Model information remains admin-only

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. **Classification Results Page** (`lib/presentation/pages/classification_results_page.dart`)

```dart
// Low confidence state - different messages based on user role
if (widget.authViewModel?.loggedInUser?.isAdmin == true) ...[
  // Admin users see original message
  const Text("We couldn't classify\nthe fiber"),
] else ...[
  // Non-admin users see simplified message
  const Text("Cannot be classified"),
],

// Grade distribution - admin only for both success and low confidence states
if (widget.authViewModel?.loggedInUser?.isAdmin == true) ...[
  // Grade distribution container
],
```

#### 2. **History Page** (`lib/presentation/pages/history_page.dart`)

```dart
// Statistics overview - admin only
if (widget.authViewModel.loggedInUser?.isAdmin == true)
  _buildStatisticsOverview(),

// History item display logic
final bool isAdmin = widget.authViewModel.loggedInUser?.isAdmin ?? false;
final bool isLowConfidence = history.confidence <= 0.5;

// Grade label and confidence visibility
Container(
  child: Text(
    (isLowConfidence && !isAdmin) 
        ? 'Cannot be classified' 
        : history.gradeLabel,
  ),
),
if (isAdmin || !isLowConfidence)
  Text(history.confidencePercentage),
```

### User Role Detection

The implementation uses the existing authentication system:

```dart
final bool isAdmin = widget.authViewModel?.loggedInUser?.isAdmin ?? false;
```

This leverages the `User.isAdmin` property which returns `true` for users with `role == 'admin'`.

## 🎨 User Experience

### For Regular Users
1. **Simplified Interface**: Clean, focused view without overwhelming technical details
2. **Clear Messaging**: "Cannot be classified" provides clear, actionable feedback
3. **Confidence in Results**: Only high-confidence results are shown with full details
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Eliminates confusing probability distributions

### For Admin Users
1. **Full Diagnostic Access**: Complete view of all classification data
2. **Model Information**: Technical details for troubleshooting and analysis
3. **Grade Distribution**: Detailed probability breakdowns for all results
4. **Historical Analytics**: Complete statistics and confidence data

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Data Privacy
- **Information Hiding**: Sensitive classification details are hidden from regular users
- **Role-Based Access**: Permissions are checked at the UI level based on user authentication
- **Consistent Application**: Restrictions apply across all relevant pages and components

### Admin Access
- **Preserved Functionality**: All admin features remain intact and accessible
- **Diagnostic Capabilities**: Full access to model switching, probability data, and statistics
- **User Management**: Admin role detection works with existing authentication system

## 🧪 Testing Recommendations

### Test Scenarios

1. **Non-Admin User with Low Confidence Result:**
   - Verify "Cannot be classified" message displays
   - Confirm grade distribution is hidden
   - Check confidence percentage is not shown

2. **Non-Admin User with High Confidence Result:**
   - Verify normal grade display
   - Confirm confidence percentage is shown
   - Check grade distribution remains hidden

3. **Admin User with Any Result:**
   - Verify all information remains visible
   - Confirm grade distributions are shown
   - Check model information displays

4. **History Page Testing:**
   - Verify statistics overview visibility based on user role
   - Test history item display for different confidence levels
   - Check details dialog behavior for both user types

### Code Coverage

The implementation maintains all existing functionality while adding role-based restrictions:
- ✅ Authentication system integration
- ✅ UI conditional rendering
- ✅ Data filtering based on user role
- ✅ Backward compatibility for admin users

## 🚀 Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Regular users get a cleaner, less confusing interface
2. **Professional Appearance**: Hides technical details that may undermine user confidence
3. **Admin Control**: Maintains full diagnostic capabilities for administrative users
4. **Data Security**: Prevents exposure of detailed classification analytics to regular users
5. **Scalability**: Framework supports easy addition of more role-based restrictions

## 📝 Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
1. **Granular Permissions**: More specific role-based permissions beyond admin/user
2. **User Preferences**: Allow users to opt into seeing more details
3. **Export Restrictions**: Limit data export capabilities based on user role
4. **Audit Logging**: Track access to sensitive classification data

**Note**: This implementation ensures a clean separation between regular user and administrative experiences while maintaining all existing functionality for authorized users.
